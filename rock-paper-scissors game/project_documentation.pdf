Project Name: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

Description:
This Python project implements a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game that allows users to play against the computer. The game keeps track of the user's score and the computer's score, and it continues until one of them reaches a specified maximum score.

How to Play:

Run the Python script.
Enter 'y' to start playing.
Set the maximum score to determine the winner.

The computer will make its choice, and the round's outcome will be displayed.
Continue playing until one player reaches the maximum score.
Modules Used:

random: Used to generate random choices for the computer.
input(): Used to get user input for choices.
print(): Used to display messages and results.

Additional Information:

The game provides feedback after each round, indicating whether the user won, lost, or had a draw with the computer.
The game is interactive and user-friendly.
